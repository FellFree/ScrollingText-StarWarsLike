Books
The 2nd edition of Getting Started with Processing is here and it's updated for Processing 3. 
It's now in full color and there's a new chapter on working with data. 
The 2nd edition of the Processing Handbook is here too. 
Every chapter has been revised, and new chapters introduce more ways to work with data and geometry. 
New “synthesis” chapters offer discussion and worked examples of such topics as sketching with code, modularity, and algorithms.
